# Leaflet Map Integration Setup

## Installation

To enable the interactive map functionality in the pharmacist dashboard, you need to install Leaflet:

```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet @types/leaflet
```

## Add Leaflet CSS and JS

Add the following to your `public/index.html` file in the `<head>` section:

```html
<!-- Leaflet CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
     integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY="
     crossorigin=""/>

<!-- Leaflet JS -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"
     integrity="sha256-20nQCchB9co0qIjJZRGuk2/Z9VM+kNiyxNV1lvTlZBo="
     crossorigin=""></script>
```
